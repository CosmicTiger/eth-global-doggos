# Doggos: Revolutionizing Pet Healthcare with Blockchain and AI


## Description

Doggos is an innovative project designed to securely store and manage essential information about dogs, including their vaccination records and medical history. By leveraging the power of blockchain technology, we ensure that this data remains immutable, transparent, and easily accessible. To enhance user experience, weâ€™re integrating an AI agent that will guide users through the application, making it intuitive and user-friendly for both dog owners and veterinarians. 

Our goal is to empower pet care with a reliable, tamper-proof system that enhances the overall health and well-being of our furry friends.

## Technologies Used

- **Blockchain**: We are using the Ethereum blockchain to store and manage the data of dogs. This ensures that the data is secure, transparent, and immutable.
- **Flow**: We are using Flow as a programming language to create the smart contracts and interact with the blockchain.
- **Coinbase Developer Platform**: We're using different tools provided by Coinbase to build interaction between the blockchain and AI agents.
- **Base**: We are using Base as a platform to build the AI agent that will guide users through the application.
- **React**: We are using React to build the front-end of the application.
- **Nest.js**: We are using Nest.js to build the back-end of the application.
- **Privy.io**: We are using Privy.io to build the user authentication system and provide embedded wallets.
