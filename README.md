## Doggos: Revolutionizing Pet Healthcare with Blockchain and AI

Doggos is an innovative project designed to securely store and manage essential information about dogs, including their vaccination records and medical history. By leveraging the power of blockchain technology, we ensure that this data remains immutable, transparent, and easily accessible. To enhance user experience, weâ€™re integrating an AI agent that will guide users through the application, making it intuitive and user-friendly for both dog owners and veterinarians. 

Our goal is to empower pet care with a reliable, tamper-proof system that enhances the overall health and well-being of our furry friends.
